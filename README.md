# 🔐 Cryptography Course

This repository contains my solutions to the **Cryptography** course as part of the Computer Science program at AGH University of Krakow. The materials focus on practical implementations of key cryptographic concepts studied during the labs.

## 📚 Topics Covered

The repository includes work related to:

* Symmetric cryptography
* Public-key cryptography (RSA, Diffie–Hellman)
* Hash functions, MACs, and KDFs
* Post-quantum cryptography (lattice-based GGH)
* Homomorphic encryption

## 📁 Repository Structure

* **lab2/** → Arithmetic and algebra for cryptography
* **lab3/** → Symmetric cryptography
* **lab4/** → Public-key cryptography (RSA & Diffie–Hellman)
* **lab5/** → Hash functions, MACs, and KDFs
* **lab6/** → Post-quantum cryptography (lattice-based GGH)
* **lab7/** → Homomorphic encryption

> ⚠️ **Note:** Lab 1 is not included in this repository, as it consisted only of executing terminal commands rather than programming tasks.

## 🛠️ How to Use

Each `labX/` folder contains Jupyter notebooks (`.ipynb`). You can open them using Jupyter Notebook, JupyterLab, or VS Code with Jupyter support.
